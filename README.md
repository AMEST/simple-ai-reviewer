# Simple AI Reviewer

## Description

The Simple AI Reviewer is designed to assist developers working alone. It aims to highlight potential issues within a codebase, offer suggestions for improvements, or simply provide a fresh perspective.   
It's important to note that its outputs may be insightful, misleading, or entirely useless - treat its suggestions with a healthy dose of skepticism.  This tool is intended as a supplement to your own expertise, not a replacement for it.
