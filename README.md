## üìù Description

The **Simple AI Reviewer** is designed to assist developers working alone. It aims to highlight potential issues within a codebase, offer suggestions for improvements, or simply provide a fresh perspective.   

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**:  
Its outputs may be insightful, misleading, or entirely useless ‚Äî treat its suggestions with a healthy dose of skepticism. This tool is intended as a **supplement to your own expertise**, not a replacement for it.

## üåê Compatibility with Git Hosting

Currently supports:  
* **Gitea**
* **Github**

## üõ† Getting Started

## üéØ Example Usage

1. Create a Pull Request in your Gitea/Github repository
2. Write comment in PR with text `/start_review`
3. ü§ñ The AI Reviewer will automatically analyze the changes and post comments
4. üîç Review the suggestions and apply them as needed

## üìå Notes

*   This is a basic implementation and may require adjustments based on your project's specific needs.
*   Consider providing feedback to help improve the accuracy and usefulness of the AI reviewer.
*   Remember to validate the reviewer's findings and use your own judgment.
*   **‚ùóSome file reviews may miss lines to which the comment pertains (while this feature exists, it depends on the model used)**
*   **‚ùóIn principle, a lot depends on the models used to conduct the review. Testing was done with the following models:**
    *   `Ollama`
        *   `Gemma3:1b` - Weak and suitable for very simple Pull Requests, but in general it finds and highlights useful things. In the per-file review mode - useless
        *   `Gemma3:4b` - Relatively well reviews in the regular comments mode (as far as possible for a small model), but in the per-file review mode it poorly specifies files and lines; It can link all comments to one file. Per-file mode is not even worth trying
    *   `Openai-compatible`
        *   `deepseek-chat` - Not bad reviews in the regular comments mode. In the per-file review mode it also successfully links comments/advice/questions to files, but sometimes (or more precisely in 50%) it misses the exact diff line, but you can't get used to it
